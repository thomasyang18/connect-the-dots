# This code is not safe for viewing.

This repository is the most magical piece of software ever, a horrendous mix of programmer hacks and AI generated slop. 

I think at some points, the code, which should just be O(n), turns into O(n^5) rebuilding. unsync/manually synced states, going all over the place w.r.t. exposability.... not object oriented.... so much implicitly coupled logic... 

Ya, not my finest piece of engineering work. The end product is kinda cool though! Not really interested in maintaining it - it's just a cool little demo. Efficiency also doesn't really matter; you should stop playing at n=16 anyways.

(At n=~40, it gets hard to even click adjacent nodes precisely T-T)
