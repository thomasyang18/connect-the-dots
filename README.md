# Please don't. 

This repository is the most magical piece of software ever, a horrendous mix of programmer hacks and AI generated slop. 

I just wanted something out, man. I don't particularly like web-dev, but I do like this project idea. 

So much O(n^10) code, unsync/manually synced states, going all over the place w.r.t. exposability.... not object oriented....

whatever.
