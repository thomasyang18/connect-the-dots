# This code is not safe for viewing.

This repository is the most magical piece of software ever, a horrendous mix of programmer hacks and AI generated slop. 

I think at some points, the code, which should just be O(n), turns into O(n^5) rebuilding. unsync/manually synced states, going all over the place w.r.t. exposability.... not object oriented.... so much implicitly coupled logic... 

Ya, not my finest piece of engineering work. The end product is kinda cool though! Banged this out in a day. I'm probably not going to add more features to this, but I'm always willing to add more explanations! 

Consider <a href="https://github.com/thomasyang18/connect-the-dots/issues">opening an issue</a> if any part of the algorithmic explanation was not clear. I genuinely believe that, once you have this dynamic, interactive setup and explain the goal to somebody, with minimal guidance and suggestive hints, they can and will come up with the idea themselves. So if you aren't getting it, it's my fault (for example, I realize that observation 14 is extremely terse, and I'm sorry.... realizing that for me took an hour, lol.); please open an issue!
