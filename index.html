            <p>This is a competitive programming problem. Pretty neat, right? </p>
            <p>
                This problem is problem K, "Connect the Dots", from <b>2022-2023 Winter Petrozavodsk Camp, Day 2: GP of ainta</b>.
                The link to the problem is <a href="https://codeforces.com/gym/104427/problem/K" target="_blank">here</a>; 
                you definitely look it up online if this link ceases to work. Try writing some code to solve this! This game 
                just provided the general algorithm: can you optimize the steps to O(n)? :)

                The main point of this project was to try and really show what goes on in someone's brain and how they could've come up with this solution.
                I think specifically, the line of thought:  
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>'Global' connections are hard to think about. Let's try to think about local connections first. (Make those blue triangles!) </li>
                <li>Hmm. Well, something immidiately obvious is that if there's 1 node of a certain color left, we can hook it up to the rest - there cannot be any conflicts.</li>
                <li>Okay, so let's say we have 3 colors. Hmm. Well, (r, g, b) can be collapsed. (r, r, b) can be collapsed,  
                    because the first and third colors are different. More generally, for any three 'adjacent' points 
                (w.r.t the new subpolygons), as long as the first and third in the triplet are different colors, we can connect them up by defintion, 
            and this 'shrinks' the polygon. </li>
            </ul> 

            <p>And the point is that these relatively simple, almost obvious observations are enough to solve the problem! </p>

            <p>(Haha, if you were thrown off by the terseness of observation 14, sorry! I would have to show this entire proof to show why it works.)</p>

            <p>The crucial step: If <b>no subarray looks like those I listed above</b>, then we're pigeonholed into trying a sequence (a, b, a, b....).
            To see what I mean, just try building an array of colors, from scratch, on paper!
            </p>

            <p><b>
                But this will inevitably fail because there are three colors in the array! 
            </b> You can never have an infinite repeating sequence like this, <b>as long as you maintain 3 colors are in the array.</b> 
            </p>

            <p>Well, shucks, that's the same problem we ran into for the n=13 case; there was only 1 red node, and we would've deleted it, 
                following the wrong algorithm.  
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>BUT!</b> If I went down to 2 distinct colors after an operation => I only had 1 count of a certain color => 
                We can hook that color up to every other node => We can avoid the bad case entirely. </p>

            <p>So it actually doesn't matter; just swap the priorities, so you always check for the edge case first. </p>

            <p> So you can always find a correct reduction of moves. Pretty cool, right? </p>

            <hr>
            <p>
                Of course, there's a <b>lot</b> going on behind the scenes - I <a href="https://codeforces.com/gym/104427/problem/K" target="_blank">highly reccomend trying to solve the original problem</a>, 
                and comparing its original problem statement to this one. Although they are equivalent, there are plenty of assumptions and 
                reductions you would have to make. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Nevertheless, I would consider this the 'core' of the proof, regardless. At the very least, reducing it to this form 
                is probably the most reasonable for a general audience.
            </p>

                This is a genuinely such a simple and beautiful problem.  
                <!-- When you show kids math, you don't expect it to pop out like this! You're expecting formulas and numbers. 
                At least, that was my experience with math all the way until I discovered competitive programming. -->

                I think that this puzzle has the perfect mix of logical deduction (figuring out the simple rules) and genuine creativity 
                (realizing that those simple rules combine nicely). 
            </p>
            <p>
                It's also far more grounded in a realistic visual/physical intuition, as compared 
                to something like, say, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98TQv5IAtY8">green-eyed island problem</a>.  
            </p>
            <p>    
                I am considering making a physical game out of this at some point - not commercially, just something simple to show people 
                at a family gathering or something. I really hope you learned something! 
            </p>
            <p>
                Please consider opening an issue <a href="https://github.com/thomasyang18/connect-the-dots/issues">here</a> if you thought 
                any part of my explanation is confusing - again, I wanted to create a simple game so that *anybody* could eventually get the intuition 
                for what an algorithm could look like for this problem in 5~10 minutes, and I truly believe for this problem (and most problems!), just being able to play 
                around with it and see instant feedback is a huge boost to understanding. 
            </p>
            <!-- <p>
                I'm still simplifying a lot here. For example, for me, I did not intuitively think about local connections - instead, I tried "global" ones first and recursing down.
                But once you show that 2n - 3 edges can maximally exist, looking for 'local' connections becomes more intuitive. Just a little bit. Reducing it to a polygon and proving correctness with lower/upper bounds isn't trivial.
                In fact, when we were solving this problem, 
                I never realized that we could interpret it as a polygon - all of our reductions were on the original array.
            </p>
            <p>
                Me and my friend wrote brute forcers and combined many observations to get to the final algorithm (which involved a lot of linked list shenanigans). 
                The line of thought definitely was not as clean as presented in the chat, or here. 
                As soon as my friend put out the idea that 3 colors was sufficient to achieve the polygonal bound though (still a pretty crazy idea), 
                this line of proof naturally came out.
            </p>
            <p>
                Of course, this isn't the only way to think about it - there are plenty, plenty of ways to think about it. Nevertheless, having this little game is fun :D
