  <h1>Layman's Proof for K. Connect the Dots</h1>

  <h2>The Setup</h2>
  <p>
    Picture the colored nodes arranged as the vertices of a polygon. In our proof, we focus only on operations that draw an edge between three consecutive nodes – an operation that corresponds to “deleting” the middle node.
  </p>

  <h2>Key Configurations That Work</h2>
  <p>
    There are two configurations of three consecutive nodes we know will always let us draw an edge:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>[r, g, b]</strong> – Three different colors in a row are good. (If the middle node’s color is unique – that is, the only node of its color – then we can simply connect it with every other node, so the worry about “deleting” it becomes moot.)
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>[r, g, g]</strong> – More generally, if you see any two adjacent nodes with the same color, say [r, g, g], you know you can safely delete the middle node to get [r, _, g].
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Building the Color Sequence</h2>
  <p>
    Now, think about placing nodes one by one around the polygon. Suppose we start with a node colored <strong>r</strong>. To avoid having two consecutive nodes of the same color, the next must be <strong>g</strong> (giving us [r, g]). What comes next?
  </p>
  <p>
    You cannot have [r, g, g] immediately if that were to somehow break our plan (unless it’s beneficial for us, as noted above). At the same time, [r, g, b] is a configuration we like. If it doesn’t occur immediately, you might instead end up with [r, g, r] and so on.
  </p>
  <p>
    No matter how you continue this process, you cannot avoid eventually hitting one of our “good” cases – either [r, g, b] or a situation where two consecutive nodes share the same color. This inevitability comes from the fact that, by assumption, every color appears at least once.
  </p>

  <h2>The Endgame: N = 4</h2>
  <p>
    At some point, by repeatedly “deleting” the middle node when a good configuration occurs, you’ll reduce the polygon to just 4 nodes. For N = 4, you can check directly that an edge can always be drawn – even if the process of deletions doesn’t preserve all three colors, the small graph is simple enough to fix.
  </p>
  <p>
    In fact, after all these moves, you can always “fix” the graph in exactly N-3 moves.
  </p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    This process of logical deduction—starting with the full polygon, identifying a move (drawing an edge by “deleting” a middle node) that works in either of two scenarios, and reducing the problem step by step—demonstrates that you can always reach a stage (N = 4) where drawing the edge is clear.
  </p>
  <p>
    In summary, by focusing only on drawing an edge on three consecutive nodes, we see that either a configuration of three distinct colors or one with two consecutive same-colored nodes will eventually appear. This forces the sequence to eventually yield one of the two “good” cases, enabling us to reduce the problem until it is easily solved. That’s the beauty of logical deduction!
